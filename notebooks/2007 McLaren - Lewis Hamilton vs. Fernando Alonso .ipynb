    "### 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula 1 (aka F1) is an international racing series that currently involves ten different teams, each with two drivers. The number of teams has varied across the years since Formula 1 started in 1950. Some of the teams, formally called “constructors”, are familiar to the general population through their production of commercial cars. These include Ferrari, Mercedes, McLaren, and Renault. Each race is known as a Grand Prix and the location of these races have changed (and will continue to change) over time. Currently, in 2020, there are 10 teams in Formula 1 who participate 17 races.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the winner of the annual series works through a point system. The current system awards points to the top 10 drivers; the closer you finish to first, the more points you receive. The driver with the most points at the end of the season is the world champion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a F1 weekend is as follows. First is Friday practice where drivers have two 90-minute opportunities (once in the morning and once in the afternoon) to familiarize themself with the track. On Saturday morning, the third and final practice session takes place for an hour and this is followed by qualifying in the afternoon. This afternoon session lasts about an hour and is split into 3 sessions: Q1, Q2, Q3. In the first qualifying session (Q1), all 20 drivers race on the track at the same time and the five slowest drivers are eliminated. They fill positions 16-20 in the actual race, corresponding to when they finished in this qualifying round. In Q2, the remaining 15 cars all race simultaneously and the slowest 5 cars are once again eliminated. These 5 drivers take positions 15-11, with their positions analogous to how they finsihed in Q2. Finally, in Q3, the remaining 10 drivers compete for pole (first) position and the fastest driver takes this position. They will start in first place on the grid when the race starts the following day. Sunday is the day of the actual race where all drivers compete for podiums (top 3 placement). You can read more about the Grand Prix format here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this project, we'll be focusing on the main race on Sunday."

    "### 2. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained this data from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use different metrics to compare the two McLaren drivers in the 2007 season: Fernando Alonso (from Spain) and Lewis Hamilton (from the UK). Alonso has been around in F1 since 2001 and has is a 2x world champion, known to derive a lot of power from poorly-engineered cars. Conversely, this is Hamilton's first season in Formula 1; he was previously racing in GP2 (a former F1 feeder).\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics we'll be using to evaluate each driver will be their ability to:\n",
    "   - Begin towards the front of the pack (good grid/starting positioning)\n",
    "   - Maintaining/Improving their positioning in each lap of a given race\n",
    "   - Drive quickly by studying lap times\n",
    "   - Win races\n",
    "   - Win points\n",
    "    \n",
    "Clearly, wins and points will be more heavily weighted since these directly dictate a driver's standing in a season. However, grid positioning and speed heavily influence these two factors and can help undercover any nuances between drivers who have similar number of wins/points."

After the files were cleaned, I used SQL to join relevant fields from different tables and then made some final changes prior to this analysis."

    "   - 2007 Japanese Grand Prix: Alonso crashed, blaming it on the rain earlier in the day.\n",

He only held a one position advantage in 60% of the races where he did finish better than his teammate. Conversely, Hamilton tended to put more space between Alonso when he ws the leading McLaren driver. Evidently, we have favorable findings for both drivers."
